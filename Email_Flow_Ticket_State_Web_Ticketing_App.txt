# Email Flow and Ticket State Document: Web Ticketing Application

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the lifecycle of a ticket within the web ticketing application, referred to as "Ticket States." It also outlines the automated email notification system designed to keep users and administrators informed about the progress and status of tickets.

## 2. Ticket States

The following states define the lifecycle of a ticket from submission to closure:

*   **Nouveau (New)**
    *   **Significance:** This is the initial state of a ticket immediately after a user submits it through the ticket creation form. The request has been logged in the system but has not yet been reviewed or assigned by an administrator.

*   **Pris en charge (Acknowledged/Assigned)**
    *   **Significance:** An administrator has reviewed the new ticket and has either acknowledged its receipt and validity or has assigned it to a specific collaborator or team for resolution. This state indicates that the ticket is now actively in the administrative queue.

*   **En cours (In Progress)**
    *   **Significance:** The assigned collaborator has commenced active work on resolving the issue or fulfilling the request described in the ticket.

*   **En attente (Pending)**
    *   **Significance:** The progression of the ticket is temporarily paused because it requires additional information from the user, or it is awaiting a response or action from an external party (e.g., a third-party vendor). The ticket remains open but is not actively being worked on by the collaborator.

*   **Résolu (Resolved)**
    *   **Significance:** The assigned collaborator has completed all necessary actions to address the issue or request. The solution or outcome should be documented in the ticket. The user will be notified that their issue is considered resolved.

*   **Fermé (Closed)**
    *   **Significance:** The ticket is considered fully concluded. This state typically follows "Résolu" after a confirmation from the user that they are satisfied with the resolution, or after a predefined period of inactivity if no further issues are reported by the user regarding the resolution. No further work is expected on a closed ticket.

## 3. Email Notifications (User-Focused)
