    The rest of the styles previously in this file have been removed
    as they are now handled by Tailwind CSS utility classes applied
    directly in the HTML files (index.html, admin.html) or via
    JavaScript (js/main.js, js/admin.js).

    This includes:
    - General body styling (padding, background-color, color, font-family, line-height)
    - Global h1 styling
    - .message-area, .message-area.success, .message-area.error styles
    - Various commented-out blocks for containers, forms, admin dashboard elements,
      and modal styles, which were noted as "mostly replaced by Tailwind".

    Relying on Tailwind CSS for these aspects ensures consistency and leverages
    the utility-first approach. Any specific global styles that are not
    achievable easily with Tailwind or are true global overrides could be
    placed here, but currently, none are needed.
